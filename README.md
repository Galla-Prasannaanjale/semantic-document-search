# Semantic Document Search using Text Embeddings

This project implements a semantic search engine that retrieves documents
based on meaning rather than keyword matching.

## Technologies
- Python
- SentenceTransformers
- FAISS
- NumPy

## How It Works
- Documents are converted to embeddings
- Query is converted to embedding
- FAISS retrieves most similar document

## Example
Query: techniques for working with text  
Output: Natural language processing deals with text data
